Similarly, GDF11 concentration in the different tissues including the intestine was significantly reduced in 9-month-old fish, compared with that of 6-month-old fish. For both 6- and 9-month-old fish, GDF11 level was highest in the brain. Broadly speaking, the change pattern of GDF11 levels was basically consistent with that of gdf11 mRNA levels. The only difference was that in the intestine, GDF11 content decreased with age but gdf11 mRNA did not.",n/a

One mechanism possibly contributing to these aging-related changes is an age-associated, CpG site-specific change in methylation in DNA associated with the promoter region of the Egr1 gene. Complex transcriptional and epigenetic changes in the hippocampus significantly contribute to brain and cognitive aging. mRNA was measured by real time RT-PCR .",n/a
